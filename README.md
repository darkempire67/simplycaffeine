# Simply Caffeine (SiFe)

Simply Caffeine is a mobile friendly website that will allow users to order coffee through a web interface and have it be delivered to the any classroom on campus. The intended market would be people who are held late during long lectures, those who had/have no time to grab coffee, or simply those that are too lazy. The customer will first be presented with a simple interface that will include: images of the drink options, a description of each drink, price per drink, and customers can buy multiples of each item as well. Once they have finalized their order they will be redirected to a secondary page, “Checkout” page, in which they will be presented with the estimated time of delivery and total cost. Once the order is placed the customer will be redirected again to a new page that will confirm their order has been processed and countdown of the estimated delivery time will be prompted.

When the order is processed the orders will be sent to a webpage only viewable to the coffee shop. This page will have a list of orders the coffee shop needs to deliver: name, item(s), delivery destination

A separate page will then be available to the delivery person where they can view the customer name, item name, and destination. Once they arrive at the class room, they will press a button that notifies the customer, through email, that their order has arrived.
