Alaska Wilderness Blend <br/>
This is a full-bodied coffee that will delight the palette of the serious coffee drinker. A strong hint of smokiness is evident in the aroma and first taste.
<br/><br/><br/>
Bali Blue Moon Organic RFA<br/>
A complex coffee with an exotic and syrupy body with hints of chocolate, vanilla and spice. Does well as a light roast and dark roast.
<br/><br/><br/>
Bolivia FTO Colonial Carana<br/>
These coffee farmers are known as “colonials”. During the 1950’s, wealthy and large land owners took over this region. They confiscated the properties from the natives, then enslaved the people  by forcing them to work for them. In 1991, through a governmental land reform, the larger landowners were made to relinquish their holdings of these small farms and return the rightful ownership back to the families who had originally owned them. These small farms still  surround the parameters of the large landowners, but they are no longer reliant on them for survival. They are independent and have title to their own land. They now have the freedom to search  for ways to improve their income, their own  lives, and the health of their community.

Brazil Cerrado – Conventional<br/>
This coffee delights the senses with the taste of ripe, chocolate-toned fruit without a hint of sharpness or acidity. Moderate aging further rounds its flavor while developing body that is deep, creamy and full.

Brazil Peaberry Certified Organic<br/>
Brazil Poco Fundo Café Femenino Natural Organic
Brazil Swiss Water Process 15/16 SS Fine Cup Decaffeinated Coffee
A fun easy to drink, flavorful decaf coffee that really does have a great taste at an affordable price. Good for both drip and espresso.
<br/><br/><br/>
Cascadia Blend Decaf FTO<br/>
This coffee is so smooth you wouldn’t know it is decaffeinated! A blend of some of the best coffee growing regions of the world.
<br/>
“The goal of this mix is to allow the Cascadia to be used as a satisfying drip blend, while also having enough complexity to shine in the espresso machine as well.”

Colombia FTO Cafe Femenino<br/>
The participating women are all part of the 1st level Cooperative COSURCA, in the southern state of Cauca. There are about 160 participating women in the Café Femenino program, averaging 3.5 acres each. A good number of these women are single heads of household, but not all, many of have husbands with their own plots of coffee.<br/>

Currently the group is working with the Café Femenino Foundation (a grant received through CORDAID) on a two year plan to develop the integration of women into the structural rolls of the cooperative, focusing on leadership development.
